The numerous fossils found in the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies are evidence of the proliferation of species during the 'Cambrian Explosion'

In today's program "Life on Earth" presented by David Attenborough, the fossils in Mistaken Point in Newfoundland was also described in great detail.

We have visited the Canadian Rockies, but I do not recall any reference to the Burgess Shale. Need to look it up on the map.
